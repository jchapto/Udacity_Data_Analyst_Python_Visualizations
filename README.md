# Ford go bike trip data
## by Javier Chapto


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

The main findings of this report are the following:

. The distributions of distance and trip duration are approximately normal when plotted in a logarithmic scale. If plotted with a regular scale, they adopt a distribution skewed to the right.

. There are significantly more suscribers than customers, more males than females and more users that are not participating in the bike share for all trip program.

. Surprisingly, there is a very weak correlation between distance and duration. However, if we plot trip duration, there's a "cealing" of distance, that varies linearly with trip duration.

. The main trends that can be observed are that customers have a higher trip duration than suscribers, and that those who are not involved in the bike share for all trip program have a higher distance than those who are involved.


## Key Insights for Presentation

. When the distribution of trip duration (min) is analyzed using a histogram with a standard scale, it is skewed to the right. However, when it is plotted with a logarithmic scale, the distribution is approximately normal.

. Most of the rides are made by males, suscribers and not involved in the 'bike share for all trip' program.

. The longest rides are made by females whose user type is customer.
